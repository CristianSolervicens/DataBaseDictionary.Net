## Description:
Is a simple program to create a Database Dictionary based on SQL Server Extended Properties.
It generates an HTML documentation file with variosus options where you can include or omit
the various supported database objects: Tables, Views, Stored Procedure, Views, Functions (scalar and tabular).

## Note:
It works together with SQLCrypt (you can download it from my Github account)
SQLCrypt is a simple and ligthweight, jet powerful SQL Server Client which allows you, among other things,
to edit SQL Server Extended Properties through a very simple interface.
Include features like "Frecuent Queries", you save them in a special folder and then you execute them from a list
